# Stephanie's GitHub Portfolio
This repository contains any UX/UI mockups, designs, or prototypes that I've built either as a personal or academic project, or for a client. Find a blurb of each project below!

## goalpro-prototype-hci: GoalPro Webapp
I created this prototype with a team of 2 other students during my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course at the University of Florida. The idea for the application was a student-oriented goal and task-tracking site that allowed for collaborative tracking and portable data accessible on multiple platforms. For the project, we also conducted user research prior to implementation of the prototype and used user-centered design principles to create the original interface design. In addition, we also conducted usability tests with a small group of students to gather feedback about our prototype.
